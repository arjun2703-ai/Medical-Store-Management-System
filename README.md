# Medical-Store-Management-System
A medical store management system is a comprehensive software solution designed to streamline and automate various operations in a medical store or pharmacy. It aims to improve efficiency, accuracy, and overall management of the store's inventory, sales, purchases, and other administrative tasks.

Medical Stores have kept paper record in filing cabinets. Managing a very large pharmacy with records on papers will be tedious and difficult to keep track of inventories with regards to the drugs 
in the store, expiry date, quantity of drugs available based on the categories and their functions. The pharmacist\Owner has to order drugs to replenish the already diminishing stock. In addition, 
ordering of drugs is being carried out manually. Significant amount of time is allocated for writing the order as the pharmacist needs to go through the stock balance and make rough estimate of the 
amount to order based on research.
